              <p>
                Intelligent Document Processing really is and why EVERY
                organization needs IDP in today's world. However, the current
                approach for IDP is flawed, it requires too much upfront
                investment and resources from organizations in its current form.
                Hence why the IDP market is mainly geared towards large
                organizaitons. Our solution changes that dynamic by providing
                "customized, ready-made solutions" that can be consumed
                immediately by organizaitons without having to 'wait' to realize
                value (i.e. having to build model, deploy etc...). We are
                'commoditinzg IDP' with our framework, enabling smaller
                organizations to get the primary benefits of IDP (extracting
                data from documents and reducing manual effort) without having
                to spend extra on features that are not a priority to many SMBs
                (I.e. Keyword analytics or "fancy UIs that supposedly enables
                'regular users' to create enterprise models when in reality,
                they're not going to be as proficient as actual data
                scientists).

              in it's fundamental technology, almost ALL IDP providers utilize
              the same OCR engines provided by Google, Amazon and Microsoft
              (except for those who built their own engine...which often charge
              ALOT for their product) and they just slap their own UI
              application on top of it and call it a "new solution". However,
              all of these providers are expecting the customer to continue
              building out their models for their organizations, so the customer
              will have to establish a capability internally to really reap all
              the benfeits. SMBs rarely want to commit that much in today's
              environment, instead they just "WANT A SOLUTION" that solves their
              problem, like 'do you have a model for that can work on any US
              drivers licenses?'...our framework enables us to build
              comprehensive models, quickly and our approach enables cutomers to
              consume them at a cost NO OTHER provider can come close to.

                <p>
                  Netra is fundamentally different than almost any otherIDP
                  provider. We donâ€™t have a "UI" or any application that a
                  "business user" can use to build a model. Our platform is made
                  up of modules of code that perform specific functions that
                  streamline the process of creating enterprise-grade IDP models
                  that can work on any use case/document. Thus, you have to be a
                  data scientist or programmer to be able to build one with our
                  platform (a bottleneck, yes. However, we are trying to lean
                  into the point that "data scientists should be building
                  models, and by trying to create a 'layer' on top your
                  technology that helps non-data scientists try to build models
                  only makes the overall process more inefficienct and
                  expensie), however the BUILDING BLOCKS OF CODE in our platform
                  and the WAY WE IMPLEMENT THEM are the key differentiators to
                  use.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Our solution is trained by our data scientists, using our GPUs
                  and resources (instead of the clients who have to build them
                  and spend money on AWS/Azure etc..) so our clients can deploy
                  them in ANY ENVIRONMENT, without requiring even an internet
                  connection. It can directly integrate into our clients
                  workflows and extract data from documents that are sourced
                  from any location (in a DOucment Management System, Email,
                  Share drives etc...) and extract the necessary data and send
                  the data to any application/location.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to our approach, we are able to provide pricing at a
                  level, no one can come close to. Most IDP providers charge
                  based on "PEr Page fees" or "Project Fees" plus "Annual
                  Licensing Costs" etc...causing it to be confusing for many
                  potential customers, expecially those with limited budget. Our
                  solution once trained doesn't require anything further from
                  the customer, we just integrate the model into their
                  environment and that's it unless there are any updates to be
                  made. Thus, the normal IDP price range starts at $50,000 or
                  more just to START and that can go up significantly dpeending
                  on page requirements etc......in our attempt to 'commoditize
                  IDP', we are changing the pricing model to be $1/Day,
                  unlimited documents.

                <p>
                  Our Values are based around the idea that IDP as a concept is
                  simple, you are extracting data from a document and taking
                  that data and putting it somewhere. Sure, there are many
                  different types of documents (Structured, Semi-structured,
                  Unstructured, Dimensional) with their own complexities (i.e.
                  handwritten text etc...)...but the VAST majority of documents
                  DO NOT NEED fancy features, they need barebones functionality
                  that deliver on what it's supposed to do...just like a
                  commodity. We value in being transparent and not to 'oversell'
                  our importance...we're not changing the world or trying to. We
                  are just trying to make it so simple for SMBs to leverage IDP
                  that it can turn into the 'commodity' it really is.

                  We believe that organizations of any size should be able to
                  leverage the benefits of IDP, we don't believe organizations
                  should have to pay based on the amount of documents they need
                  to process or have to pay licensing fees every year. We are
                  trying to again 'commoditize' the IDP space, the automation
                  technology called 'RPA' has become 'commoditized' because when
                  you compare the Top 3 Vendors (Uipath, Automaiton Anywhrere,
                  Blue Prism) SOLELY upon their RPA technology (not their
                  otherproduts within their suite like "Document Understanding"
                  from Uipath which is IDP) they are essentially a 'wash'. They
                  all have pretty much the same capabilities and of course they
                  do, they all do the same thing...they automate repetitive,
                  common tasks...sure, some of them are able to do fancier
                  things but that goes OUTSIDE the bounds of RPA. The same
                  concept applies to IDP, we are extracting data from documents
                  and putting them somewhere, nothing more. All capabilities who
                  add "advanced analytics" or "Workflow automation" on top of it
                  are just trying to add functionality to their fundamental
                  capability, which is again, being able to extract data.

                <p>
                  Our framework and approach of models not to focus on "use
                  cases" (like build a model for Invoices) but rather on
                  fundamental components (an invoice will always have a 'table'
                  within it that outlines the line items being bought...we have
                  a 'Table extractor model' that can automate the extration of
                  that table from any invoice...but it can also work on a
                  medical claim which ALSO has a table in it..just with
                  different data. We are approaching this more fundamentally
                  than other providers and want to highlight in here that our
                  plan once we scale is to have a 'library' of "ready-made"
                  solutions that organizations no matter how small can just buy
                  and add to their automation program. So imagine small
                  businesses who want to move into a new service line (i.e.
                  Mortgage lending...but currently you only do personal lending,
                  you can already have all 1003 mortgage application data is
                  automatically extracted and transferred to Origination system
                  for an underwriter to review) theyu could leverage netra to
                  address a core fundamental part of businesses, data
                  extraction. We provide a mechanism to offer it at a price no
                  one else can match because they already 'sold their soul' (so
                  to speka) to Venture Capital funds at big valuations and
                  sub-optimal frameworks.

                  We have "ready-made" models for specific use cases like

                  Identification", but then we have our "Core Models" like
                  "Table Extractor" or "Para" or "Signature Idenitfication"
                  models which serve as 'components' that are applied to
                  different use cases. Please refer to GTM sheet on excel file
                  to see from a customer perspective, they either need one or
                  all of our ready-made models and then we can build new models
                  for other documents using our 'Netra framework (the core
                  models like Table Extractor), all we would need is to acquire
                  their data (the amount of sample vary based on model
                  complexity) and build out model and then integrate into the
                  clients workflow within 4 weeks* (depending on project scope).

                <p>
                  In reality, we are willing as a company to build a model for
                  free for the client because we can then reuse and sell that
                  model for the next client and so on. The client would only pay
                  a fee for usage of model on a per user basis for our initial
                  rollout. We are trying to gain mass adoption among SMBs, so by
                  providing models at no cost to build which also feeds our
                  library of solutions that we can then sell to next clients
                  with same need. If they want to use any of our "ready-made"
                  models (like Drivers license or 'Signtuare Verification') we
                  can then sell that to them on the $1Day/User per Model or we
                  can come to an agreement on price. As we are early we want to
                  state that pricing is subject to change based on market
                  demand. We are just trying to make as big an impact as
                  possible.
