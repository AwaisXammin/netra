                IDP is a key technology when it comes to processing huge loads
                of documents. Despite the complicated jargon used by many IDP
                providers, IDP is not rocket science and is very accessible for
                medium or small size companies. NETRA offers a “no-frills” IDP
                solution that works and requires a minimum of expertise on
                behalf of the client.

              </h2>
              <p>
                IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) has become a workhorse of
                today’s industrious world. Extracting data from a large variety
                of documents and feeding them reliably into the organization’s
                database has revolutionized our workflows. However, many
                mid-size and smaller companies are still struggling with the
                introduction of IDP, as licensing models of the main players
                exceed their budget and deployment of their large-scale
                solutions is often complicated and cost-prohibitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                NETRA is revolutionizing the market by offering a solution that
                makes IDP affordable to everyone and with a minimum of expertise
                on the customer’s side. How could we possibly do that? Many
                traditional IDP solutions are bloated with features only a small
                percentage of users need. NETRA’s solution is down-to-earth and
                yet very powerful as we don’t burden the client with building
                models and learning IDP jargon.

              in it's fundamental technology, almost ALL IDP providers utilize
              the same OCR engines provided by Google, Amazon and Microsoft
              (except for those who built their own engine...which often charge
              ALOT for their product) and they just slap their own UI
              application on top of it and call it a "new solution". However,
              all of these providers are expecting the customer to continue
              building out their models for their organizations, so the customer
              will have to establish a capability internally to really reap all
              the benfeits. SMBs rarely want to commit that much in today's
              environment, instead they just "WANT A SOLUTION" that solves their
              problem, like 'do you have a model for that can work on any US
              drivers licenses?'...our framework enables us to build
              comprehensive models, quickly and our approach enables cutomers to
              consume them at a cost NO OTHER provider can come close to.

                The Truth
                <span class="heading-color"> About IDP</span>
              </h2>
              <p>
                Today’s IDP solutions are very powerful and loaded with features
                like AI (artificial intelligence), hand writing recognition,
                image processing and more. With today’s compute power, almost
                anything is possible. But do we need AI (artificial
                intelligence) to find the data-of-birth field on a form? In
                fact, 99 percent of all document processing makes use of image
                processing tools, but are not “intelligent” in any way and don’t
                need to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                All an effective IDP system needs for functioning is a solid
                recipe of how to find the extractable data on a sheet and where
                to put them. The formulation of this recipe requires an
                extensive amount of software flexibility and user expertise.
                That is why most IDP systems come with an overwhelmingly large
                user interface layer, which again comes with a whole new world
                of terminology. They require the client’s personnel to acquire
                an incredible amount of expertise. This is almost like teaching
                every airline passenger how to fly, instead of placing two
                pilots up front.
              </p>
              <p>
                NETRA’s approach is entirely different. Our systems do not come
                with a cockpit-like user interface, but just as a toolkit of
                highly efficient modules. And we provide with it the ‘pilots’
                that write the recipe for you on how those modules should work
                together. We call that recipe a model. And the best thing is:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The model comes for free! </strong><br />
                In a nutshell, NETRA’s IDP solution does not require you to hire
                specialists to build models, has affordable license costs, and
                can easily be tied into your current IT structure. Too good to
                be true? Turn the page to see how we can do it.

                <p>
                  Our platform is a collection of modules that perform specific
                  functions which streamline the process of creating
                  enterprise-grade IDP models and can work on any use
                  case/document. And instead of requiring you to hire expensive
                  specialists for building these models, our specialist will do
                  the modeling work for you – for free! That saves you a huge
                  investment and also creates a more efficient solution by
                  avoiding unnecessary software layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Creating an efficient IDP solution can be compared to solving
                  a big jigsaw puzzle. As our experts know exactly how to
                  optimally use the capabilities of our code modules and how to
                  utilize compute resources like GPUs beneficially, the
                  resulting solutions are lean and efficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While many IDP providers require the use of internet
                  connections and cloud platforms, our solutions can be deployed
                  in a totally sealed-off environment. Our module framework
                  gives us the flexibility to tie into whatever storage
                  facilities and compute resources you have on-site, eliminating
                  many questions about data security.

                  The Beauty
                  <span class="heading-color">of Simplicity</span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Simplicity is a virtue of the finest and most successful
                  products—reducing a product to its core functions, but
                  optimizing those to perfection. That’s what we did with the
                  Netra platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty of Netra lies in the simplicity of its
                  architecture. It consists of a set of highly optimized modules
                  that perform the heavy-lifting of IDP-related tasks. Yet, it
                  is extremely easy to integrate into an existing IT landscape.
                  The glue between these modules does not come in the form of a
                  complicated user-interface layer as in many other IDP
                  products, but in a very flexible layer of Python code. What
                  looks like a simple idea at first, soon demonstrates its
                  usefulness when it comes to interconnecting the IDP solution
                  to existing data sources or hooking up to a large variety of
                  services. This layer results in an unprecedented flexibility
                  when creating new IDP models. And instead of asking your data
                  specialists to learn Python and the functionality of our
                  libraries, we will write those modules for you—if we don’t
                  have them already on stock.

            Every IDP project is different, but there is a common blueprint that
            underlies all projects. Starting an IDP project with Netra is
            especially easy.

              <h4>Inquiry</h4>
              <p>
                You inquire about a model for a particular application. Either
                we have that model already in stock, in which case we continue
                with phase Model Evaluation or we will develop a tailor-made
                model for you. In that phase we also discuss where your
                operational data is sourced from and where the extracted data
                will be placed.

              <h4>Training Set Preparation</h4>
              <p>
                You send us a set of sample documents that we call the training
                set. As preparation for the development of a model, this
                training set needs to be annotated, that is we manually
                determine the desired output data for each document. The
                training set should have a reasonable size, so the model we
                build is prepared for all those variations that occur in
                real-world documents.

              <h4>Model Training</h4>
              <p>
                We will develop the new model and use automated training
                mechanisms to fine-tune the model accordingly. This step is a
                combination of software development and machine learning. The
                development part includes telling the model where to find the
                various pieces of information. The training will prepare the
                model for any kind of variations in format and placement of
                fields.

              <h4>Model Evaluation</h4>
              <p>
                You send us a second set of sample documents, which again will
                be annotated. We call this the evaluation set. This set is used
                to verify that the model works as expected, indepen¬dently from
                the training set. The annotation allows an automated check of
                the model’s correctness.

              <p>
                The model will be deployed at your premises and on your own
                hardware. Of course, we will support you during this phase to
                get things running as seamlessly and quickly as possible. We do
                not require your personnel to become IDP specialists or do weeks
                of training and preparations.

              <p>
                The world is in motion and so are your documents. Changes do
                occur over time. And those changes sometimes have to be
                reflected in the IDP software. We will stand by your side,
                should any changes become necessary, be it to the model or the
                embedding in your infrastructure.

                  Netra is fundamentally different than almost any otherIDP
                  provider. We don’t have a "UI" or any application that a
                  "business user" can use to build a model. Our platform is made
                  up of modules of code that perform specific functions that
                  streamline the process of creating enterprise-grade IDP models
                  that can work on any use case/document. Thus, you have to be a
                  data scientist or programmer to be able to build one with our
                  platform (a bottleneck, yes. However, we are trying to lean
                  into the point that "data scientists should be building
                  models, and by trying to create a 'layer' on top your
                  technology that helps non-data scientists try to build models
                  only makes the overall process more inefficienct and
                  expensie), however the BUILDING BLOCKS OF CODE in our platform
                  and the WAY WE IMPLEMENT THEM are the key differentiators to
                  use.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Our solution is trained by our data scientists, using our GPUs
                  and resources (instead of the clients who have to build them
                  and spend money on AWS/Azure etc..) so our clients can deploy
                  them in ANY ENVIRONMENT, without requiring even an internet
                  connection. It can directly integrate into our clients
                  workflows and extract data from documents that are sourced
                  from any location (in a DOucment Management System, Email,
                  Share drives etc...) and extract the necessary data and send
                  the data to any application/location.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to our approach, we are able to provide pricing at a
                  level, no one can come close to. Most IDP providers charge
                  based on "PEr Page fees" or "Project Fees" plus "Annual
                  Licensing Costs" etc...causing it to be confusing for many
                  potential customers, expecially those with limited budget. Our
                  solution once trained doesn't require anything further from
                  the customer, we just integrate the model into their
                  environment and that's it unless there are any updates to be
                  made. Thus, the normal IDP price range starts at $50,000 or
                  more just to START and that can go up significantly dpeending
                  on page requirements etc......in our attempt to 'commoditize
                  IDP', we are changing the pricing model to be $1/Day,
                  unlimited documents.

                <p>
                  Our Values are based around the idea that IDP as a concept is
                  simple, you are extracting data from a document and taking
                  that data and putting it somewhere. Sure, there are many
                  different types of documents (Structured, Semi-structured,
                  Unstructured, Dimensional) with their own complexities (i.e.
                  handwritten text etc...)...but the VAST majority of documents
                  DO NOT NEED fancy features, they need barebones functionality
                  that deliver on what it's supposed to do...just like a
                  commodity. We value in being transparent and not to 'oversell'
                  our importance...we're not changing the world or trying to. We
                  are just trying to make it so simple for SMBs to leverage IDP
                  that it can turn into the 'commodity' it really is.

                  We believe that organizations of any size should be able to

                  technology called 'RPA' has become 'commoditized' because when
                  you compare the Top 3 Vendors (Uipath, Automaiton Anywhrere,
                  Blue Prism) SOLELY upon their RPA technology (not their
                  otherproduts within their suite like "Document Understanding"
                  from Uipath which is IDP) they are essentially a 'wash'. They
                  all have pretty much the same capabilities and of course they
                  do, they all do the same thing...they automate repetitive,
                  common tasks...sure, some of them are able to do fancier
                  things but that goes OUTSIDE the bounds of RPA. The same
                  concept applies to IDP, we are extracting data from documents
                  and putting them somewhere, nothing more. All capabilities who
                  add "advanced analytics" or "Workflow automation" on top of it
                  are just trying to add functionality to their fundamental
                  capability, which is again, being able to extract data.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Our framework and approach of models not to focus on "use
                  cases" (like build a model for Invoices) but rather on
                  fundamental components (an invoice will always have a 'table'
                  within it that outlines the line items being bought...we have
                  a 'Table extractor model' that can automate the extration of
                  that table from any invoice...but it can also work on a
                  medical claim which ALSO has a table in it..just with
                  different data. We are approaching this more fundamentally
                  than other providers and want to highlight in here that our
                  plan once we scale is to have a 'library' of "ready-made"
                  solutions that organizations no matter how small can just buy
                  and add to their automation program. So imagine small
                  businesses who want to move into a new service line (i.e.
                  Mortgage lending...but currently you only do personal lending,
                  you can already have all 1003 mortgage application data is
                  automatically extracted and transferred to Origination system
                  for an underwriter to review) theyu could leverage netra to
                  address a core fundamental part of businesses, data
                  extraction. We provide a mechanism to offer it at a price no
                  one else can match because they already 'sold their soul' (so
                  to speka) to Venture Capital funds at big valuations and
                  sub-optimal frameworks.

                <p>
                  In reality, we are willing as a company to build a model for
                  free for the client because we can then reuse and sell that
                  model for the next client and so on. The client would only pay
                  a fee for usage of model on a per user basis for our initial
                  rollout. We are trying to gain mass adoption among SMBs, so by
                  providing models at no cost to build which also feeds our
                  library of solutions that we can then sell to next clients
                  with same need. If they want to use any of our "ready-made"
                  models (like Drivers license or 'Signtuare Verification') we
                  can then sell that to them on the $1Day/User per Model or we
                  can come to an agreement on price. As we are early we want to
                  state that pricing is subject to change based on market
                  demand. We are just trying to make as big an impact as
                  possible.

                <p>
                  We started Netra with an objective to deliver outstanding
                  business process improvement outcomes across verticals and
                  customer sizes using intelligent automation. Our goal is to
                  democratize usage of IDP solutions by providing 100% secure,
                  highly accurate and cost-effective on-premise IDP solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our approach Having worked closely with traditional IDP
                  players, we felt there is a need to create a no-frills
                  on-premise solution that delivers high accuracy and 100% data
                  security at a fraction of the cost. Netra does just that. At
                  99 cents/day/model/user, the ROI Netra delivers today is
                  peerless
