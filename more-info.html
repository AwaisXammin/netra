                Document Processing) has become a workhorse of today’s
                industrious world. Extracting data from a large variety of
                documents and feeding them reliably into the organization’s
                database has revolutionized our workflows. However, many
                mid-size and smaller companies are still struggling with the
                introduction of IDP, as licensing models of the main players
                exceed their budget and deployment of their large-scale
                solutions is often complicated and cost-prohibitive.

                Today’s IDP solutions are very powerful and loaded with features
                like AI (artificial intelligence), hand writing recognition,
                image processing and more. With today’s compute power, almost
                anything is possible. But do we need AI (artificial
                intelligence) to find the data-of-birth field on a form? In
                fact, 99 percent of all document processing makes use of image
                processing tools, but are not “intelligent” in any way and don’t
                need to be.

                All an effective IDP system needs for functioning is a solid
                recipe of how to find the extractable data on a sheet and where
                to put them. The formulation of this recipe requires an
                extensive amount of software flexibility and user expertise.
                That is why most IDP systems come with an overwhelmingly large
                user interface layer, which again comes with a whole new world
                of terminology. They require the client’s personnel to acquire
                an incredible amount of expertise. This is almost like teaching
                every airline passenger how to fly, instead of placing two
                pilots up front.

                NETRA’s approach is entirely different. Our systems do not come
                with a cockpit-like user interface, but just as a toolkit of
                highly efficient modules. And we provide with it the ‘pilots’
                that write the recipe for you on how those modules should work
                together. We call that recipe a model. And the best thing is:

                In a nutshell, NETRA’s IDP solution does not require you to hire
                specialists to build models, has affordable license costs, and
                can easily be tied into your current IT structure. Too good to
                be true? Turn the page to see how we can do it.

                100% secure! Internet connectivity is required only for initial
                install, deployment and license activation. Can work on

                Our models can be deployed in a matter of minutes with just one
                line of code and can be made available for use immediately. They
                can be deployed just as easily on any operating system; whether
                Windows, Linux or Mac. They don't require high-end systems or
                GPUs to run. Designed in a way that any resource with basic
                computer knowledge can also operate it with ease

                  Netra is fundamentally different than almost any otherIDP
                  provider. We don’t have a "UI" or any application that a
                  "business user" can use to build a model. Our platform is made
                  up of modules of code that perform specific functions that
                  streamline the process of creating enterprise-grade IDP models
                  that can work on any use case/document. Thus, you have to be a
                  data scientist or programmer to be able to build one with our
                  platform (a bottleneck, yes. However, we are trying to lean
                  into the point that "data scientists should be building
                  models, and by trying to create a 'layer' on top your
                  technology that helps non-data scientists try to build models
                  only makes the overall process more inefficienct and
                  expensie), however the BUILDING BLOCKS OF CODE in our platform
                  and the WAY WE IMPLEMENT THEM are the key differentiators to
                  use.

                <p>
                  Our solution is trained by our data scientists, using our GPUs
                  and resources (instead of the clients who have to build them
                  and spend money on AWS/Azure etc..) so our clients can deploy
                  them in ANY ENVIRONMENT, without requiring even an internet
                  connection. It can directly integrate into our clients
                  workflows and extract data from documents that are sourced
                  from any location (in a DOucment Management System, Email,
                  Share drives etc...) and extract the necessary data and send
                  the data to any application/location.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to our approach, we are able to provide pricing at a
                  level, no one can come close to. Most IDP providers charge
                  based on "PEr Page fees" or "Project Fees" plus "Annual
                  Licensing Costs" etc...causing it to be confusing for many
                  potential customers, expecially those with limited budget. Our
                  solution once trained doesn't require anything further from
                  the customer, we just integrate the model into their
                  environment and that's it unless there are any updates to be
                  made. Thus, the normal IDP price range starts at $50,000 or
                  more just to START and that can go up significantly dpeending
                  on page requirements etc......in our attempt to 'commoditize
                  IDP', we are changing the pricing model to be $1/Day,
                  unlimited documents.

                  Our Values are based around the idea that IDP as a concept is
                  simple, you are extracting data from a document and taking
                  that data and putting it somewhere. Sure, there are many
                  different types of documents (Structured, Semi-structured,
                  Unstructured, Dimensional) with their own complexities (i.e.
                  handwritten text etc...)...but the VAST majority of documents
                  DO NOT NEED fancy features, they need barebones functionality
                  that deliver on what it's supposed to do...just like a
                  commodity. We value in being transparent and not to 'oversell'
                  our importance...we're not changing the world or trying to. We
                  are just trying to make it so simple for SMBs to leverage IDP
                  that it can turn into the 'commodity' it really is.

                <p>
                  Our framework and approach of models not to focus on "use
                  cases" (like build a model for Invoices) but rather on
                  fundamental components (an invoice will always have a 'table'
                  within it that outlines the line items being bought...we have
                  a 'Table extractor model' that can automate the extration of
                  that table from any invoice...but it can also work on a
                  medical claim which ALSO has a table in it..just with
                  different data. We are approaching this more fundamentally
                  than other providers and want to highlight in here that our
                  plan once we scale is to have a 'library' of "ready-made"
                  solutions that organizations no matter how small can just buy
                  and add to their automation program. So imagine small
                  businesses who want to move into a new service line (i.e.
                  Mortgage lending...but currently you only do personal lending,
                  you can already have all 1003 mortgage application data is
                  automatically extracted and transferred to Origination system
                  for an underwriter to review) theyu could leverage netra to
                  address a core fundamental part of businesses, data
                  extraction. We provide a mechanism to offer it at a price no
                  one else can match because they already 'sold their soul' (so
                  to speka) to Venture Capital funds at big valuations and
                  sub-optimal frameworks.
