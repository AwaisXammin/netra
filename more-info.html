                database has revolutionized our workflows. However, many
                mid-size and smaller companies are still struggling with the
                introduction of IDP, as licensing models of the main players
                exceed their budget and deployment of their large-scale

              in it's fundamental technology, almost ALL IDP providers utilize
              the same OCR engines provided by Google, Amazon and Microsoft
              (except for those who built their own engine...which often charge
              ALOT for their product) and they just slap their own UI
              application on top of it and call it a "new solution". However,
              all of these providers are expecting the customer to continue
              building out their models for their organizations, so the customer
              will have to establish a capability internally to really reap all
              the benfeits. SMBs rarely want to commit that much in today's
              environment, instead they just "WANT A SOLUTION" that solves their
              problem, like 'do you have a model for that can work on any US
              drivers licenses?'...our framework enables us to build
              comprehensive models, quickly and our approach enables cutomers to
              consume them at a cost NO OTHER provider can come close to.

                Today’s IDP solutions are very powerful and loaded with features
                like AI (artificial intelligence), hand writing recognition,
                image processing and more. With today’s compute power, almost
                anything is possible. But do we need AI (artificial
                intelligence) to find the data-of-birth field on a form? In
                fact, 99 percent of all document processing makes use of image
                processing tools, but are not “intelligent” in any way and don’t
                need to be.

                All an effective IDP system needs for functioning is a solid
                recipe of how to find the extractable data on a sheet and where
                to put them. The formulation of this recipe requires an
                extensive amount of software flexibility and user expertise.
                That is why most IDP systems come with an overwhelmingly large
                user interface layer, which again comes with a whole new world
                of terminology. They require the client’s personnel to acquire
                an incredible amount of expertise. This is almost like teaching
                every airline passenger how to fly, instead of placing two
                pilots up front.

              </div>
              <p>
                NETRA’s approach is entirely different. Our systems do not come
                with a cockpit-like user interface, but just as a toolkit of
                highly efficient modules. And we provide with it the ‘pilots’
                that write the recipe for you on how those modules should work
                together. We call that recipe a model. And the best thing is:

                <strong>The model comes for free! </strong><br />
                In a nutshell, NETRA’s IDP solution does not require you to hire
                specialists to build models, has affordable license costs, and
                can easily be tied into your current IT structure. Too good to
                be true? Turn the page to see how we can do it.

                  Our platform is a collection of modules that perform specific
                  functions which streamline the process of creating
                  enterprise-grade IDP models and can work on any use
                  case/document. And instead of requiring you to hire expensive
                  specialists for building these models, our specialist will do
                  the modeling work for you – for free! That saves you a huge
                  investment and also creates a more efficient solution by
                  avoiding unnecessary software layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Creating an efficient IDP solution can be compared to solving
                  a big jigsaw puzzle. As our experts know exactly how to
                  optimally use the capabilities of our code modules and how to
                  utilize compute resources like GPUs beneficially, the
                  resulting solutions are lean and efficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While many IDP providers require the use of internet
                  connections and cloud platforms, our solutions can be deployed
                  in a totally sealed-off environment. Our module framework
                  gives us the flexibility to tie into whatever storage
                  facilities and compute resources you have on-site, eliminating
                  many questions about data security.

                  <span class="heading-color">Powerhouse Modules</span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  There are two disciplines that lie at the core of every IDP
                  project: Locating the desired content and converting it to
                  data, that is: into a string of character codes. Netra excels
                  in both disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Locating the content often means recognizing a table structure
                  on paper and finding the table cells. Easy if the table has
                  grid of lines, but difficult if those lines are missing.
                  Netra’s table extractor module is prepared for tables of all
                  types, with and without grids, with colored backgrounds,
                  nested tables, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the content has been located it has to be converted to a
                  character string, which is what our OCR module does. Netra
                  uses its own OCR engine, which is superior to what you find
                  generally in the market. The quality of the OCR engine is
                  crucial for achieving reliable results. Hence, we have
                  optimized our OCR in many different ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those are just two examples of the Netra modules from which we
                  build highly reliable solutions. Most of our modules use deep
                  learning techniques to be easily trainable to new source
                  material. At the end of the day, it’s the quality of the
                  modules that determines the quality of an IDP solution and
                  that’s where Netra’s focus is.

                <p>
                  We believe that organizations of any size should be able to
                  leverage the benefits of IDP, we don't believe organizations
                  should have to pay based on the amount of documents they need
                  to process or have to pay licensing fees every year. We are
                  trying to again 'commoditize' the IDP space, the automation
                  technology called 'RPA' has become 'commoditized' because when
                  you compare the Top 3 Vendors (Uipath, Automaiton Anywhrere,
                  Blue Prism) SOLELY upon their RPA technology (not their
                  otherproduts within their suite like "Document Understanding"
                  from Uipath which is IDP) they are essentially a 'wash'. They
                  all have pretty much the same capabilities and of course they
                  do, they all do the same thing...they automate repetitive,
                  common tasks...sure, some of them are able to do fancier
                  things but that goes OUTSIDE the bounds of RPA. The same
                  concept applies to IDP, we are extracting data from documents
                  and putting them somewhere, nothing more. All capabilities who
                  add "advanced analytics" or "Workflow automation" on top of it
                  are just trying to add functionality to their fundamental
                  capability, which is again, being able to extract data.

                  Netra is fundamentally different than almost any otherIDP
                  provider. We don’t have a "UI" or any application that a
                  "business user" can use to build a model. Our platform is made
                  up of modules of code that perform specific functions that
                  streamline the process of creating enterprise-grade IDP models
                  that can work on any use case/document. Thus, you have to be a
                  data scientist or programmer to be able to build one with our
                  platform (a bottleneck, yes. However, we are trying to lean
                  into the point that "data scientists should be building
                  models, and by trying to create a 'layer' on top your
                  technology that helps non-data scientists try to build models
                  only makes the overall process more inefficienct and
                  expensie), however the BUILDING BLOCKS OF CODE in our platform
                  and the WAY WE IMPLEMENT THEM are the key differentiators to
                  use.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Our solution is trained by our data scientists, using our GPUs
                  and resources (instead of the clients who have to build them
                  and spend money on AWS/Azure etc..) so our clients can deploy
                  them in ANY ENVIRONMENT, without requiring even an internet
                  connection. It can directly integrate into our clients
                  workflows and extract data from documents that are sourced
                  from any location (in a DOucment Management System, Email,
                  Share drives etc...) and extract the necessary data and send
                  the data to any application/location.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Due to our approach, we are able to provide pricing at a
                  level, no one can come close to. Most IDP providers charge
                  based on "PEr Page fees" or "Project Fees" plus "Annual
                  Licensing Costs" etc...causing it to be confusing for many
                  potential customers, expecially those with limited budget. Our
                  solution once trained doesn't require anything further from
                  the customer, we just integrate the model into their
                  environment and that's it unless there are any updates to be
                  made. Thus, the normal IDP price range starts at $50,000 or
                  more just to START and that can go up significantly dpeending
                  on page requirements etc......in our attempt to 'commoditize
                  IDP', we are changing the pricing model to be $1/Day,
                  unlimited documents.

                <p>
                  Our Values are based around the idea that IDP as a concept is
                  simple, you are extracting data from a document and taking
                  that data and putting it somewhere. Sure, there are many
                  different types of documents (Structured, Semi-structured,
                  Unstructured, Dimensional) with their own complexities (i.e.
                  handwritten text etc...)...but the VAST majority of documents
                  DO NOT NEED fancy features, they need barebones functionality
                  that deliver on what it's supposed to do...just like a
                  commodity. We value in being transparent and not to 'oversell'
                  our importance...we're not changing the world or trying to. We
                  are just trying to make it so simple for SMBs to leverage IDP
                  that it can turn into the 'commodity' it really is.

                  Our framework and approach of models not to focus on "use
                  cases" (like build a model for Invoices) but rather on
                  fundamental components (an invoice will always have a 'table'
                  within it that outlines the line items being bought...we have
                  a 'Table extractor model' that can automate the extration of
                  that table from any invoice...but it can also work on a
                  medical claim which ALSO has a table in it..just with
                  different data. We are approaching this more fundamentally
                  than other providers and want to highlight in here that our
                  plan once we scale is to have a 'library' of "ready-made"
                  solutions that organizations no matter how small can just buy
                  and add to their automation program. So imagine small
                  businesses who want to move into a new service line (i.e.
                  Mortgage lending...but currently you only do personal lending,
                  you can already have all 1003 mortgage application data is
                  automatically extracted and transferred to Origination system
                  for an underwriter to review) theyu could leverage netra to
                  address a core fundamental part of businesses, data
                  extraction. We provide a mechanism to offer it at a price no
                  one else can match because they already 'sold their soul' (so
                  to speka) to Venture Capital funds at big valuations and
                  sub-optimal frameworks.
